  \caption{Timeline of event code and component usage, with every timepoint as an event on the x axis. For clarity, we hide most of the event coding labels other than the insight labels. Black vertical tick indicates a session break, signaling the beginning of a new line of inquiry.}\label{fig:evalstudytimeline}
