@article{Heer2012,
abstract = {The increasing scale and availability of digital data provides an extraordinary resource for informing public policy, scientific discovery, business strategy, and even our personal lives. To get the most out of such data, however, users must be able to make sense of it: to pursue questions, uncover patterns of interest, and identify (and potentially correct) errors. In concert with data-management systems and statistical algorithms, analysis requires contextualized human judgments regarding the domain- specific significance of the clusters, trends, and outliers discovered in data. Visualization provides a powerful means of making sense of data. By mapping data attributes to visual properties such as position, size, shape, and color, visualization designers leverage perceptual skills to help users discern and interpret patterns within data.11 A single image, however, typically provides answers to, at best, a handful of questions. Instead, visual analysis typically progresses in an iterative process of view creation, exploration, and refinement. Meaningful analysis consists of repeated explorations as users develop insights about significant relationships, domain-specific contextual influences, and causal patterns. Confusing widgets, complex dialog boxes, hidden operations, incomprehensible displays, or slow response times can limit the range and depth of topics considered and may curtail thorough deliberation and introduce errors. To be most effective, visual analytics tools must support the fluent and flexible use of visualizations at rates resonant with the pace of human thought. The goal of this article is to assist designers, researchers, professional analysts, procurement officers, educators, and students in evaluating and creating visual analysis tools. We present a taxonomy of interactive dynamics that contribute to successful analytic dialogues. The},

abstract = {We present detailed non-LTE synthetic spectra of hydrodynamic supernovae (SNe) Ia models. We make no assumptions about the form of the spectrum at the inner boundary. We calculate both Chandrasekhar-mass deflagration models and sub-Chandrasekhar "helium detonators." Gamma-ray deposition is handled in a simple, accurate manner. We have parameterized the storage of energy, which arises from the time-dependent deposition of radioactive decay energy, in a reasonable manner that spans the expected range. We find that the Chandrasekhar-mass deflagration model W7 of Nomoto, Thielemann, {\&} Yokoi shows good agreement with the observed spectra of SN 1992A and SN 1994D, particularly in the UV, where our models are expected to be most accurate. The sub-Chandrasekhar models do not reproduce the UV deficit observed in normal SNe Ia. They do bear some resemblance to subluminous SNe Ia, but the shapes of the spectra (i.e., the colors) are opposite that of the observed ones, and the intermediate-mass element lines (such as Si II and Ca II) are extremely weak, which seems to be a generic difficulty of the models. Although the sub-Chandrasekhar models have a significant helium abundance (unlike Chandrasekhar-mass models), helium lines are not prominent in the spectra near maximum light and thus do not act as a spectral signature for the progenitor.},

These trends are broadly impacting many scientific fields, including genomics, astronomy, and neuroscience. We can attack the problem caused by exponential data growth by applying horizontally scalable techniques from current ana-lytics systems to accelerate scientific processing pipelines. In this paper, we describe ADAM, an example genomics pipeline that leverages the open-source Apache Spark and Parquet systems to achieve a 28× speedup over current ge-nomics pipelines, while reducing cost by 63{\%}. From building this system, we were able to distill a set of techniques for implementing scientific analyses efficiently using commodity " big data " systems. To demonstrate the generality of our ar-chitecture, we then implement a scalable astronomy image processing system which achieves a 2.8–8.9× improvement over the state-of-the-art MPI-based system.},

Current systems that support such queries either provide limited expressiveness, hinder exploratory workflows or present interaction and visualization models which do not scale well to large and multi-faceted data sets. In this paper we present (s|qu)eries (pronounced "Squeries"), a visual query interface for creating queries on sequences (series) of data, based on regular expressions. (s|qu)eries is a touch-based system that exposes the full expressive power of regular expressions in an approachable way and interleaves query specification with result visualizations. Being able to visually investigate the results of different query-parts supports debugging and encourages iterative query-building as well as exploratory work-flows. We validate our design and implementation through a set of informal interviews with data scientists that analyze event sequences on a daily basis.},

abstract = {There is a clear need for interactive exploration of extremely large databases, especially in the area of scientific data management where ingestion of multiple Terabytes on a daily basis is foreseen. Unfor-tunately, current data management technology is not well-suited for such overwhelming demands. In light of these challenges, we should rethink some of the strict requirements database systems adopted in the past. We envision that next generation database systems should interpret queries by their intent , rather than as a contract carved in stone for complete and correct answers.  The result set should aid the user in un-derstanding the database's content and provide guidance to con-tinue the data exploration journey. A scientist can stepwise explore deeper and deeper into the database, and stop when the result con-tent and quality reaches his satisfaction point. At the same time, response times should be close to instant such that they allow a scientist tointeract with the system and explore the data in a con-textualized way. Several research directions are carved out to realize this vision. They range from engineering a novel database kernel where speed rather than completeness is the first class citizen, up to refusing to process a costly query in the first place, but providing advice on how to reformulate it instead, or even providing alternatives the system believes might be relevant for the exploration patterns ob-served.},

abstract = {High performance computing (HPC) has driven collaborative science discovery for decades. Exascale computing platforms, currently in the design stage, will be deployed around 2022. The next generation of supercomputers is expected to utilize radically different computational paradigms, necessitating fundamental changes in how the community of scientific users will make the most efficient use of these powerful machines. However, there have been few studies of how scientists work with exascale or close-to-exascale HPC systems. Time as a metaphor is so pervasive in the discussions and valuation of computing within the HPC community that it is worthy of close study. We utilize time as a lens to conduct an ethnographic study of scientists interacting with HPC systems. We build upon recent CSCW work to consider temporal rhythms and collective time within the HPC sociotechnical ecosystem and provide considerations for future system design.},

abstract = {Even though "providing insight" has been considered one of the main purposes of information visualization (InfoVis), we feel that insight is still a not-well-understood concept in this context. Inspired by research in sensemaking, we realized the importance of the procedural aspects in understanding insight. Thus, rather than asking "What is insight?" we instead focus on "How do people gain insights?" In an effort to better understand and characterize insight, we reviewed previous literature in InfoVis, seeking other researchers' comments and views on this concept. We found that: 1) Insights are often regarded as end results of using InfoVis and the procedures to gain insight have been largely veiled; 2) Four largely distinctive processes of gaining insight (Provide Overview, Adjust, Detect Pattern, and Match Mental Model) have been discussed in the InfoVis literature; and 3) These different processes provide some hints to understand the procedures in which insight can be gained from InfoVis. We hope that our findings help researchers and practitioners evaluate InfoVis systems and technologies in a more insight-oriented way.},

abstract = {Any system designed for people to use should be (a) easy to learn; (b) useful, i.e., contain functions people really need in their work; (c) easy to use; and (d) pleasant to use. In this note we present theoretical considerations and empirical data relevant to attaining these goals. First, we mention four principles for system design which we believe are necessary to attain these goals; Then we present survey results that demonstrate that our principles are not really all that obvious, but just seem obvious once presented. The responses of designers suggest they may sometimes think they are doing what we recommend when in fact they are not. This is consistent with the experience that systems designers do not often recommend or use them themselves. We contrast some of these responses with what we have in mind in order to provide a more useful description of our principles. Lastly, we consider why this might be so. These sections are summaries of those in a longer paper to appear elsewhere (Gould {\&} Lewis, 1983). In that paper we elaborate on our four principles, showing how they form the basis for a general methodology of design, and we describe a successful example of using them in actual system design (IBM's Audio Distribution System).},

abstract = {Microarrays are relatively new, high-throughput data acquisition technology for investigating biological phenomena at the micro-level. One of the more common procedures for microarray experimentation is that of the microarray time-course experiment. The product of microarray time-course experiment is time-series data, which subject to proper analysis has the potential to have significant impact on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases. While existing information visualization techniques go some way to making microarray time-series data more manageable, requirements analysis has revealed significant limitations. The main finding was that users were unable to uncover and quantify common changes in value over a specified time-period. This paper describes a novel technique that provides this functionality by allowing the user to visually formulate and modify measurable queries with separate time-period and condition components. These visual queries are supported by the combination of a traditional value against time graph representation of the data with a complementary scatter-plot representation of a specified time-period. The multiple views of the visualization are coordinated so that the user can formulate and modify queries with rapid reversible display of query results in the traditional value against time graph format.},

abstract={Cellular responses to stimuli are rapid and continuous and yet the vast majority of investigations of transcriptional responses during developmental transitions typically use long interval time courses; limiting the available interpretive power. Moreover, such experiments typically focus on protein-coding transcripts, ignoring the important impact of long noncoding RNAs. We therefore evaluated coding and noncoding expression dynamics at unprecedented temporal resolution (6-hourly) in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells and report new insight into molecular processes and genome organization. We present a highly resolved differentiation cascade that exhibits coding and noncoding transcriptional alterations, transcription factor network interactions and alternative splicing events, little of which can be resolved by long-interval developmental time-courses. We describe novel short lived and cycling patterns of gene expression and dissect temporally ordered gene expression changes in response to transcription factors. We elucidate patterns in gene co-expression across the genome, describe asynchronous transcription at bidirectional promoters and functionally annotate known and novel regulatory lncRNAs. These findings highlight the complex and dynamic molecular events underlying mammalian differentiation that can only be observed though a temporally resolved time course.},

abstract = {Figure 1: Eviza's interface showing a map of earthquake data in the United States. The interface supports natural language analytical questions in the context of a visualization. Here, the map shows marks selected in response to the user's query " find large earthquakes near California. " The system semantically associates the sized descriptor 'large' to an attribute in the dataset called 'magnitude' that can be associated with size. Eviza finds two ambiguities in the query: 'large' and 'near,' which are fuzzy terms for size and distance. The system sets 'large' to be of magnitude 5 and greater, while 'near' is a 100 mile radius around the border of California. Two ambiguity widgets are added to the interface to allow the user to modify these settings. ABSTRACT Natural language interfaces for visualizations have emerged as a promising new way of interacting with data and performing ana-lytics. Many of these systems have fundamental limitations. Most return minimally interactive visualizations in response to queries and often require experts to perform modeling for a set of predicted user queries before the systems are effective. Eviza provides a natural language interface for an interactive query dialog with an existing visualization rather than starting from a blank sheet and ask-ing closed-ended questions that return a single text answer or static visualization. The system employs a probabilistic grammar based approach with predefined rules that are dynamically updated based on the data from the visualization, as opposed to computationally intensive deep learning or knowledge based approaches. The result of an interaction is a change to the view (e.g., filtering, navigation, selection) providing graphical answers and ambiguity widgets to handle ambiguous queries and system defaults. There is also rich domain awareness of time, space, and quantitative reason-ing built in, and linking into existing knowledge bases for additional semantics. Eviza also supports pragmatics and exploring multi-modal interactions to help enhance the expressiveness of how users can ask questions about their data during the flow of visual analysis.},

A multitude of similarity measures have been introduced to perform pattern searches. The accuracy of such measures is often evaluated objectively using a one nearest neighbor classification (1NN) on labeled time series or through clustering. Prior work often disregards the subjective similarity of time series which can be pivotal in systems where a user specified pattern is used as input and a similarity-based ranking is expected as output (query-by-example). In this paper, we describe how a human-annotated ranking based on real-world queries and datasets can be created using simple crowdsourcing tasks and use this ranking as ground-truth to evaluate the perceived accuracy of existing time series similarity measures. Furthermore, we show how different sampling strategies and time series representations of pen-drawn queries effect the precision of these similarity measures and provide a publicly available dataset which can be used to optimize existing and future similarity search algorithms.},

abstract = {In most development projects, descriptions and prototypes are developed by system designers on their own utilizing users as suppliers of information on the use domain. In contrast, we are proposing a cooperative prototyping approach where users are involved actively and creatively in design and evaluation of early developed prototypes. This paper will present a detailed analysis of an example of application of the approach - design of computer support for casework in a technical department of a local government, where urban planning and environmental control of companies are central work tasks. The analysis starts out from the mutual object of design: the work processes of the prospective users. We look at design as a learning process and analyze various situations where openings for learning occur in the prototyping activity. These situations seem to fall into three categories: the first is situations where the future work situation is simulated and the conditions of the future work activity investigated, in particular the role of the computer application. The second is where the prototype is used as a basis for discussion and articulation of problems with the current work practice, and goals of the future one. The third kind of situations are situations where the design situation as such becomes the focus. Based on the example and earlier results we discuss benefits, problems and prospects of the approach. In particular we discuss the tension between needs for careful preparation of prototyping sessions and establishing good conditions for user and designer creativity. The message with this respect is that users and designers should learn from breakdowns and focus shifts in the prototyping sessions rather than trying to avoid them. 1.},

abstract = {In today's applications data is produced at unprecedented rates. While the capacity to collect and store new data grows rapidly, the ability to analyze these data volumes increases at much lower pace. This gap leads to new challenges in the analysis process, since analysts, decision makers, engineers, or emergency response teams depend on information "concealed" in the data. The emerging field of visual analytics focuses on handling massive, heterogenous, and dynamic volumes of information through integration of human judgement by means of visual representations and interaction techniques in the analysis process. Furthermore, it is the combination of related research areas including visualization, data mining, and statistics that turns visual analytics into a promising field of research. This paper aims at providing an overview of visual analytics, its scope and concepts, and details the most important technical research challenges in the field},

The thought-processes and procedures are focused on the data, and always return to the data i.e., the grounding in GTM is grounding in the data. In GTM, there is no hypothesis to be tested. Rather, research is guided by open-ended questions, and by a set of rigorous strategies that guide data collection, the choice of which data to sample, and the method for developing and testing insights into the data. The result is a rich, deeply interwoven description of the phenomena, and a set of new open-ended questions for further work.

abstract = {There have been repeated calls for studies in behavioral science and human-computer interaction (HCI) research to measure participants' actual behaviors. HCI research studies often use multiple constructs as perceived measures of behavior, which are captured using participants' self-reports on surveys. Response biases, however, are a widespread threat to the validity of self-report measures. To mitigate this threat to validity, we propose that studies in HCI measure actual behaviors in appropriate contexts rather than solely perceptions. We report an example of using movements that reflect both actual behavior and behavioral changes measured within a health care IS usage context, specifically the detection and alleviation of neuromuscular degenerative disease. We propose and test a method of monitoring mouse-cursor movements to detect hand tremors in real time when individuals are using websites. Our work suggests that analyzing hand movements as an actual (rather than perceptual) measure of usage could enrich other areas of IS research (e.g., technology acceptance, efficacy, fear, etc.), in which perceptions of states and behavior are measured post hoc to the interaction and subject to the threats of various forms of response bias.},

@article{Battle2016,
abstract = {In this paper, we present ForeCache, a general-purpose tool for ex-ploratory browsing of large datasets. ForeCache utilizes a client-server architecture, where the user interacts with a lightweight client-side interface to browse datasets, and the data to be browsed is re-trieved from a DBMS running on a back-end server. We assume a detail-on-demand browsing paradigm, and optimize the back-end support for this paradigm by inserting a separate middleware layer in front of the DBMS. To improve response times, the middleware layer fetches data ahead of the user as she explores a dataset. We consider two different mechanisms for prefetching: (a) learn-ing what to fetch from the user's recent movements, and (b) us-ing data characteristics (e.g., histograms) to find data similar to what the user has viewed in the past. We incorporate these mech-anisms into a single prediction engine that adjusts its prediction strategies over time, based on changes in the user's behavior. We evaluated our prediction engine with a user study, and found that our dynamic prefetching strategy provides: (1) significant improve-ments in overall latency when compared with non-prefetching sys-tems (430{\%} improvement); and (2) substantial improvements in both prediction accuracy (25{\%} improvement) and latency (88{\%} im-provement) relative to existing prefetching techniques.},

abstract = {Data scientists and other analytic professionals often use interactive visualization in the dissemination phase at the end of a workflow during which findings are communicated to a wider audience. Visualization scientists, however, hold that interactive representation of data can also be used during exploratory analysis itself. Since the use of interactive visualization is optional rather than mandatory, this leaves a visualization gap during initial exploratory analysis that is the onus of visualization researchers to fill. In this paper, we explore areas where visualization would be beneficial in applied research by conducting a design study using a novel variation on contextual inquiry conducted with professional data analysts. Based on these interviews and experiments, we propose a set of interactive initial exploratory visualization guidelines which we believe will promote adoption by this type of user.},

While they exhibit complementary advantages, neither paradigm alone is adequate for complex information goals that lend themselves partially to browsing and partially to searching. To integrate browsing and searching smoothly into a single interface, we introduce a novel approach called ScentTrails. Based on the concept of information scent developed in the context of information foraging theory, ScentTrails highlights hyperlinks to indicate paths to search results. This interface enables users to interpolate smoothly between searching and browsing to locate content matching complex information goals effectively. In a preliminary user study, ScentTrails enabled subjects to find information more quickly than by either searching or browsing alone.},

Humans provide invaluable domain expertise and sensemaking capabilities to this discourse with analytic models; however, little consideration has yet been given to the ways inherent human biases might shape the visual analytic process. In this paper, we establish a conceptual framework for considering bias assessment through human-in-the-loop systems and lay the theoretical foundations for bias measurement. We pro-pose six preliminary metrics to systematically detect and quantify bias from user interactions and demonstrate how the metrics might be implemented in an existing visual analytic system, InterAxis. We discuss how our proposed metrics could be used by visual ana-lytic systems to mitigate the negative effects of cognitive biases by making users aware of biased processes throughout their analyses.},

Data come from 220 franchisees engaged in innovation projects. Fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) assesses the interplay of six participation quality dimensions: (1) task-related resources, (2) early involvement, (3) degree of influence, (4) transparency of processes, (5) incentive mechanisms, and (6) voluntariness of participation. Results show that successful stakeholder participation is characterized by a complex interplay of these participation quality dimensions. While some firms are excellent in all six dimensions, other firms successfully integrate stakeholders by focusing on selected participation quality dimensions. Uncovering these complex interrelationships helps managers to better design participatory processes in new service development projects."

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2016.Empirical evaluation methods for visualizations have traditionally focused on assessing the outcome of the visual analytic process as opposed to characterizing how that process unfolds. There are only a handful of methods that can be used to systematically study how people use visualizations, making it difficult for researchers to capture and characterize the subtlety of cognitive and interaction behaviors users exhibit during visual analysis. To validate and improve visualization design, it is important for researchers to be able to assess and understand how users interact with visualization systems under realistic scenarios. This article presents a methodology for modeling and evaluating the behavior of users in exploratory visual analysis. We model visual exploration using a Markov chain process comprising transitions between mental, interaction, and computational states. These states and the transitions between them can be deduced from a variety of sources, including verbal transcripts, videos and audio recordings, and log files. This model enables the evaluator to characterize the cognitive and computational processes that are essential to insight acquisition in exploratory visual analysis and reconstruct the dynamics of interaction between the user and the visualization system. We illustrate this model with two exemplar user studies, and demonstrate the qualitative and quantitative analytical tools it affords.},
