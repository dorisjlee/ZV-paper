EXAMPLES,,,"- Filter and select gene of interest and drag and drop to find other genes that resemble this gene- used to find the most simmilar visualization in the results pane",,"1. - retrieve gene A from dataset#1 using gene A's data from dataset#2 from multiple experiments, or comparing between different species (mouse v.s. humans)- query with known important genes of interest2.- No available pattern exist, or don't know what pattern to look for. (since data is already subselected to be of the same type)3. Uploading the results of downstream regression model back into ZV to check for simmilarity to original features","3. Used to find most significant cluster pattern",,"3. Used to compare between Hierarchical relationships (e.g. functional groups v.s. genes ; state v.s. city) - Set n_observations_cycle_band>30 to clean up the data","1. Useful when data is uncleaned and trying to select smoothing algo and parameter.- Using constraint to select a specific object of interest for a particular band2. - Pattern are dense and already fairly cleaned or smoothed. - Important rare signals (transits) will get lost when smoothed.","1. Created 3 classes of low, medium and high brightness object, compounded with large and small radii objects",,,,"1.Change KMeans Cluster Size, Number of Displayed results 2.3."
1. How used?,"* Finding genes with up to down, repressed patterns [G2]* ""I want to see if there are genes with two peaks, because this is not normal"" --> checking for artifact* Examine all the genes that are repressed*sketch to query of something that is long term and slowing increasing or slowly decaying as quasars",,"* Drag and drop most significant cluster [G*, A2]* drag and drop then smoothed by sketch instead [M2]",,,,"* Find ""generally"" downward trend independent of x axis.[M1, G2]*Narrow to the range where we only care about transits (""dips""), ignore xrange so that we can find all stars that have transit patterns [A2]. * narrow to desired solvent properites range [A1]- ignore x-range to make it more like correlation as simmilarity metric- only interested in some parts of the pattern as ""features"", since a gene can be regulated by more than 1 factor which have different subpatterns.","* If there was an additional data column that indexes which network a gene belongs to, then it saves them from having to iteratively check between their results against a database (which is currently the downstream workflow).* constraints narrow to data subset or clean data [A1, M2, A3]* filter to show only datapoints that satisfies a criterion.",,,"* Figure Download*Using downloaded clusters for downstream modelling or merging clusters* Using downloaded objids by quantile groups to perform downstream analysis [A2].*Gene ontology testing: significance testing to test whether the cluster is clean enough, if not, then increase the number of clusters. Making use of other data types* Hand off to another collaborator for doing characterization of the object [A3]* the most important thing for export is to get the objid, because then you could join with other columns in another data table.","* comparing between visualizations same/different chemical classes [M1] or  functional groups [G1]* Finding correlation within a set of paired visualization [G1]* Dissimilarity: comparing between stars that habor planets and ones that don't [A2]* compare similarity and dissimilarity of two different y measurements (time series of gene expression v.s. hypersensitivity)* compare fluxes across different bands --> quasar has excess in one band but not another.* define Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) as a primitive to score how likely is this an interesting object, then take the argmax. ","* Used it in conjunction with filter to create data files for dominant cluster in each category* Flipped y axis because looking at magnitudes* Showed scatterplot",
2. Why Not Use?,"* Pattern too complex to be drawn [A2] * sketched but failed can not capture what he wants, query too imprecise [A1,M2]* No available pattern exist, or don't know what pattern to look for.",,,* No functional form available to describe phenomenon,* Every pattern in dataset very specific so no target pattern (labelled) for a class to query with [A2],* Too noisy no clear signal from the representative pattern.[A1],* whole pattern matters,,"* Smoothing can not be used on data, signal will be lost [A2]* ""with bad quality data, then you try to smooth it over then you can get correlations that are nonsensical."" [M1[","* Cannot perform dynamic class creation on non-y variable (e.g. Rstar z variable) [A2]* No additional data attributes available.* Network containment relationship are not dependent on any inequalities conditions on the variables","* Download doesn't give solvent ID, but the whole linechart. Need matching with ID otherwise useless.",,,
3. Unexpected Usage,,,* select least similar trend (most disimilar) and drag and drop the pattern [A2],,,,"* ignore x-range can be used to search across different hierarchical x attributes (e.g.monthes, quarters, cycles) --> Independent of which quarter, is there a pattern that look like this?  [A1,A2]","* created classes/categories based on quantile ranges and observed representative/outliers for that quantile [A2]* Adjust filter conditions iteratively and add constraints to see how many datapoints satisfy constraint",,,,,,
