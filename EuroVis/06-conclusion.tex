\section{Conclusion\label{sec:conclusion}}
While VQSs hold tremendous promise in accelerating data exploration, they are rarely used in practice. In this paper, we worked closely with analysts from three diverse domains to characterize how VQSs can address their analytic challenges, collaboratively design VQS features, and evaluate how VQS functionalities are used in practice. Participants were able to use our final deployed system, \zvpp, for discovering desired patterns and trends, and obtaining valuable insights to address unanswered research questions. Grounded in these experiences, we developed a sensemaking model for how analysts make use of VQSs. Contrary to past work, we found that sketch-to-query is not as effective in practice as past work may suggest. Beyond sketching, we find that each sensemaking process fulfills a central role in participants' analysis workflows to address their high-level research objectives. We advocate that future VQSs should invest in understanding and supporting all three sensemaking processes to effectively `close the loop' in how analysts interact and perform sensemaking with VQSs. While more work certainly remains to be done, by contributing to a better understanding of how VQSs are used in practice across domains, our paper can also serve as a roadmap for broader adoption of VQSs,
and hopefully trigger exploration of novel use cases for these tools.

% Through participatory design, we identified three classes of missing interface capabilities  essential for employing VQSs for facilitating insight in real scientific applications, spanning expressive querying and dynamic faceting, as well as fine-grained control and understanding, along with the ability to compose flexible workflows in an integrated manner (RQ2). Finally, our evaluation study demonstrated how these features helped accelerate scientific insights (RQ3), as well as how they fit in the context of data analysis workflows (RQ4). One such finding is that bottom-up querying (e.g., drag-and-drop) is preferred over top-down (e.g., sketching) for exploratory data analysis, contrary to what is commonly supported in existing VQSs.
