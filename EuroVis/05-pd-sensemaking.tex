    To convey how features inF \zvpp address the analytical needs posed by each domain, we organize our PD findings into a sensemaking framework for VQSs. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:taxonomy}, we develop a taxonomy for organizing VQS capabilities into three sensemaking processes. Our VQS sensemaking model is inspired by Pirolli and Card's information foraging framework~\cite{Pirolli}, which distinguishes between information processing tasks that are \textit{top-down} (from theory to data) and \textit{bottom-up} (from data to theory). Correspondingly, in the context of VQS, analysts can search either directly based on a pattern in their head via \emph{top-down pattern specification} or construct a query based on the data via \emph{bottom-up data-driven inquiry}. Moreover, when the visualized attributes are unknown to the users, \emph{context creation} helps analysts navigate across different collections of visualizations to seek visualization attributes of interest. A more detailed articulation of the problem space addressable by VQS and how each sensemaking process fits into this space can be found in Appendix~\ref{appdx:problem_space}.
    \par In this section, we first describe the design objectives of each sensemaking process. Proceeding to the lower level of the Figure~\ref{fig:taxonomy} taxonomy, we then discuss how each sensemaking process is comprised of functional components that address challenges posed by the problem and dataset characteristics of each domain. The mapping between specific \zvpp features and these functional components and sensemaking processes can be found in Table~\ref{bigfeaturetable}. Each of these VQS capabilities enable essential subtasks in accomplishing our participant's scientific goal, as exemplified in the usage scenarios in this section and further detailed in Appendix Table~\ref{science_task}.

  % In this section, we first describe the space of problems addressable by VQSs.
  % After understanding how each sensemaking process fits into the problem space \change{addressable} by VQSs,
  %  we further explore design objectives of each sensemaking process, grounded in our collaborative design experience.
  \subsection{Top-Down Pattern Search}
  Top-down pattern search begins with the \change{analyst's} intuition about how the desired patterns should look like based on ``theory'', including visualizations from past experience or abstract conceptions based on external knowledge. The goal of top-down pattern search is to address the \textit{which} question of visual sensemaking: \textit{which \change{data instances exhibit} this pattern?} Based on this preconceived notion of what to search for, the design challenge is to translate the query \change{from} the analyst's head to a query executable by the VQS. This requires both components for specifying the pattern (\textit{pattern specification}), as well as controls governing the underlying algorithm of how shape-matching is performed (\textit{match specification}).
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%Components%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \boldpara{Pattern Specification} interfaces allow users to submit exact descriptions of a pattern query. This is useful when the dataset contains \emph{large numbers of potentially-relevant pattern instances}.
  Since it is often difficult to sketch precisely, additional characteristics of the pattern query (e.g., patterns with specific shape characteristics, or expressible in a functional form) can be used to further winnow the list of undesired matches.%with the VQS returning a list of most similar matches
  \boldpara{Match Specification} addresses the well-known problem in VQSs where pattern queries are imprecise~\cite{correll2016semantics,Holz2009,Eichmann2015} by allowing users to clarifying how pattern matching should be performed. Match specification is useful when the dataset is \emph{noisy} (i.e., containing large numbers of false-positives). When the pattern query satisfies some additional constraints (e.g., pattern is x,y invariant), adjusting match specification prunes away false-positives to help reveal true candidates.
  \boldpara{Usage Scenario:} A1 knows based on a textbook definition of what a supernovae pattern should look like and the detailed shape characteristics, such as the amplitude of the peak and the level of error tolerance for defining a match. He can search for transient patterns through sketching, select the option to ignore differences along the temporal dimension, and change the similarity metric for flexible matching.
  \subsection{Context creation}
  \textit{Context creation} addresses the \textit{where} question of sensemaking by enabling analysts to navigate across different parts of the visualization collection to learn about \textit{where in the dataset do the patterns of interest lie}. The design challenge of context creation is to help users visualize and compare how data changes between different contexts by constructing different visualization collections via different visualization encodings (\textit{view specification} or different data subsets (\textit{slice-and-dice}).%to ensure that context is dynamically reflected across other VQS functionalities through
  %develop features that act as a `lens': navigating users to desired data subsets, visualizing and comparing how the data changes between the different lenses, and ensuring that context is dynamically reflected across other VQS functionalities.
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%Components%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \boldpara{View specification} settings alter the encoding for all visualizations on the VQS. This ability to work with different collections of visualizations is useful when the dataset is \emph{multidimensional} and the axes of interest is \emph{unknown}. Modifying the view specification offers analysts different perspectives on the data to locate visualization collections of interest.
  \boldpara{Slice-and-Dice} empowers users to navigate and compare collections of visualizations constructed from different portions of the data. Data navigation capabilities is essential when the dataset has \emph{large numbers of non-visualized attributes} that may be related to the visualized attributes (e.g., geographical location may influence the time series pattern for housing prices). Analysts can either make use of pre-existing knowledge regarding these ``support attributes'' to navigate to a data region that is more likely to contain the desired pattern (e.g., filtering to suburbs to find cheaper housing) or discover unknown patterns and relationships between different data subsets (e.g., housing prices is lower in winter than compared to summer).% by gaining a better understanding of characteristic patterns in particular data region.
  \boldpara{Usage Scenario:} M1 recognizes salient trends in his dataset such as inverse or linear correlations, but does not have a pattern in mind to query with. Given a list of physical properties that he is interested in, he switches between different visualized attributes or dynamically creates different classes of data to examine the data from alternative perspectives.
  \subsection{Bottom-Up Data-Driven Inquiry}
  \textit{Bottom-up data-driven inquiry} is a browsing-oriented sensemaking process that goes from data to theory to
  addresses the \textit{what} questions in visual sensemaking: \textit{what are the patterns of interest in the dataset?} The design challenge include developing the right set of ``stimuli'' through \textit{recommendations} that could provoke further data-driven inquiries, as well as low-effort mechanisms to search via these results through \textit{result querying}. As we will discuss later, this process is crucial but underexplored in past work on VQSs.
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%Components%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \boldpara{Recommendation} displays visualizations that may be of interest to users based on the current data context. Representative trends and outliers are useful for understanding common and outlying behaviors when a \emph{small number of common patterns} is exhibited in the dataset. %Understanding \emph{characteristic} patterns in dataset can help analysts discover other pattern queries of interest to jumpstart further queries.
  \boldpara{Result querying} enables users to query for patterns similar to a selected data pattern from the ranked list of results or recommendations. Typically, analyst select visualizations with \emph{semantic or visual properties} of interest and make use of results querying to understand characteristic properties of similar instances.
  \boldpara{Usage Scenario:} G2 does not have a preconceived knowledge of what to search for in the dataset. She is interested in learning about the characteristic patterns that exist in the dataset through representative trends, as a means to jumpstart further queries, as well as to understand groups of data instances with shared characteristics.
  \par The three aforementioned sensemaking processes are akin to the well-studied sensemaking paradigms of search, browse, and faceted navigation on the Web~\cite{Hearst2009,Olston2003}. Due to each of their advantages and limitations given different information seeking tasks, search interfaces have been designed to support all three complementary acts and transition smoothly between them to combine the strength of all three paradigms. \change{Similarly for VQSs, our design objective is to enable all three sensemaking in \zvpp. Our Section~\ref{sec:eval_findings} evaluation study reveals that this integrative approach not only accelerates the process of visualization discovery, but also encourages hypotheses generation and experimentation.}
