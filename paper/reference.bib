@misc {hotmap,
abstract     = {<p>Online interactive mapping systems are growing in popularity: Microsoft,
                Google, and Yahoo all offer interactive maps, with varying features and qualities
                of aerial photography. For the maintainers and designers of such systems, the
                behavior of users can provide critical cues on how both to improve their
                offerings and understand how users are now interacting with the system. The tools
                needed to track user data for these systems are different from the traditional
                tools of log file analysis. Maps have the advantage of being tied to common-sense
                geography: a world map. In contrast, many log-file analysis tools must create an
                abstract space in which to situate a node-link diagram representing the website.
                Mapping systems lack hyperlinks: while other online systems logically lead users
                between pages, online maps can be scrolled and navigated without clicking links.
                Applying a log-file analysis tool to these systems fails to represent the
                relevant dimensions of a mapping system: reconstructing a path between pages by
                examining referrer logs, for example, cannot apply. A simple reporting of the
                most-requested page requires substantial interpretation: presenting the filenames
                for individual map images is far from intuitive. Instead, the understanding of
                geography can be harnessed to build meaningful log-file visualizations by showing
                the logs as a map.</p>},

@article{Heer2012,
abstract = {The increasing scale and availability of digital data provides an extraordinary resource for informing public policy, scientific discovery, business strategy, and even our personal lives. To get the most out of such data, however, users must be able to make sense of it: to pursue questions, uncover patterns of interest, and identify (and potentially correct) errors. In concert with data-management systems and statistical algorithms, analysis requires contextualized human judgments regarding the domain- specific significance of the clusters, trends, and outliers discovered in data. Visualization provides a powerful means of making sense of data. By mapping data attributes to visual properties such as position, size, shape, and color, visualization designers leverage perceptual skills to help users discern and interpret patterns within data.11 A single image, however, typically provides answers to, at best, a handful of questions. Instead, visual analysis typically progresses in an iterative process of view creation, exploration, and refinement. Meaningful analysis consists of repeated explorations as users develop insights about significant relationships, domain-specific contextual influences, and causal patterns. Confusing widgets, complex dialog boxes, hidden operations, incomprehensible displays, or slow response times can limit the range and depth of topics considered and may curtail thorough deliberation and introduce errors. To be most effective, visual analytics tools must support the fluent and flexible use of visualizations at rates resonant with the pace of human thought. The goal of this article is to assist designers, researchers, professional analysts, procurement officers, educators, and students in evaluating and creating visual analysis tools. We present a taxonomy of interactive dynamics that contribute to successful analytic dialogues. The},

abstract = {We present detailed non-LTE synthetic spectra of hydrodynamic supernovae (SNe) Ia models. We make no assumptions about the form of the spectrum at the inner boundary. We calculate both Chandrasekhar-mass deflagration models and sub-Chandrasekhar "helium detonators." Gamma-ray deposition is handled in a simple, accurate manner. We have parameterized the storage of energy, which arises from the time-dependent deposition of radioactive decay energy, in a reasonable manner that spans the expected range. We find that the Chandrasekhar-mass deflagration model W7 of Nomoto, Thielemann, {\&} Yokoi shows good agreement with the observed spectra of SN 1992A and SN 1994D, particularly in the UV, where our models are expected to be most accurate. The sub-Chandrasekhar models do not reproduce the UV deficit observed in normal SNe Ia. They do bear some resemblance to subluminous SNe Ia, but the shapes of the spectra (i.e., the colors) are opposite that of the observed ones, and the intermediate-mass element lines (such as Si II and Ca II) are extremely weak, which seems to be a generic difficulty of the models. Although the sub-Chandrasekhar models have a significant helium abundance (unlike Chandrasekhar-mass models), helium lines are not prominent in the spectra near maximum light and thus do not act as a spectral signature for the progenitor.},

This paper discusses the challenges that are imposed by Big Data on the modern and future Scientific Data Infrastructure (SDI). The paper discusses a nature and definition of Big Data that include such features as Volume, Velocity, Variety, Value and Veracity. The paper refers to different scientific communities to define requirements on data management, access control and security. The paper introduces the Scientific Data Lifecycle Management (SDLM) model that includes all the major stages and reflects specifics in data management in modern e-Science. The paper proposes the SDI generic architecture model that provides a basis for building interoperable data or project centric SDI using modern technologies and best practices. The paper explains how the proposed models SDLM and SDI can be naturally implemented using modern cloud based infrastructure services provisioning model and suggests the major infrastructure components for Big Data Infrastructure.

These trends are broadly impacting many scientific fields, including genomics, astronomy, and neuroscience. We can attack the problem caused by exponential data growth by applying horizontally scalable techniques from current ana-lytics systems to accelerate scientific processing pipelines. In this paper, we describe ADAM, an example genomics pipeline that leverages the open-source Apache Spark and Parquet systems to achieve a 28× speedup over current ge-nomics pipelines, while reducing cost by 63{\%}. From building this system, we were able to distill a set of techniques for implementing scientific analyses efficiently using commodity " big data " systems. To demonstrate the generality of our ar-chitecture, we then implement a scalable astronomy image processing system which achieves a 2.8–8.9× improvement over the state-of-the-art MPI-based system.},

Current systems that support such queries either provide limited expressiveness, hinder exploratory workflows or present interaction and visualization models which do not scale well to large and multi-faceted data sets. In this paper we present (s|qu)eries (pronounced "Squeries"), a visual query interface for creating queries on sequences (series) of data, based on regular expressions. (s|qu)eries is a touch-based system that exposes the full expressive power of regular expressions in an approachable way and interleaves query specification with result visualizations. Being able to visually investigate the results of different query-parts supports debugging and encourages iterative query-building as well as exploratory work-flows. We validate our design and implementation through a set of informal interviews with data scientists that analyze event sequences on a daily basis.},

abstract = {There is a clear need for interactive exploration of extremely large databases, especially in the area of scientific data management where ingestion of multiple Terabytes on a daily basis is foreseen. Unfor-tunately, current data management technology is not well-suited for such overwhelming demands. In light of these challenges, we should rethink some of the strict requirements database systems adopted in the past. We envision that next generation database systems should interpret queries by their intent , rather than as a contract carved in stone for complete and correct answers.  The result set should aid the user in un-derstanding the database's content and provide guidance to con-tinue the data exploration journey. A scientist can stepwise explore deeper and deeper into the database, and stop when the result con-tent and quality reaches his satisfaction point. At the same time, response times should be close to instant such that they allow a scientist tointeract with the system and explore the data in a con-textualized way. Several research directions are carved out to realize this vision. They range from engineering a novel database kernel where speed rather than completeness is the first class citizen, up to refusing to process a costly query in the first place, but providing advice on how to reformulate it instead, or even providing alternatives the system believes might be relevant for the exploration patterns ob-served.},

The next generation of supercomputers is expected to utilize radically different computational paradigms, necessitating fundamental changes in how the community of scientific users will make the most efficient use of these powerful machines. However, there have been few studies of how scientists work with exascale or close-to-exascale HPC systems. Time as a metaphor is so pervasive in the discussions and valuation of computing within the HPC community that it is worthy of close study. We utilize time as a lens to conduct an ethnographic study of scientists interacting with HPC systems. We build upon recent CSCW work to consider temporal rhythms and collective time within the HPC sociotechnical ecosystem and provide considerations for future system design.},

Inspired by research in sensemaking, we realized the importance of the procedural aspects in understanding insight. Thus, rather than asking "What is insight?" we instead focus on "How do people gain insights?" In an effort to better understand and characterize insight, we reviewed previous literature in InfoVis, seeking other researchers' comments and views on this concept. We found that: 1) Insights are often regarded as end results of using InfoVis and the procedures to gain insight have been largely veiled; 2) Four largely distinctive processes of gaining insight (Provide Overview, Adjust, Detect Pattern, and Match Mental Model) have been discussed in the InfoVis literature; and 3) These different processes provide some hints to understand the procedures in which insight can be gained from InfoVis. We hope that our findings help researchers and practitioners evaluate InfoVis systems and technologies in a more insight-oriented way.},

abstract = {Any system designed for people to use should be (a) easy to learn; (b) useful, i.e., contain functions people really need in their work; (c) easy to use; and (d) pleasant to use. In this note we present theoretical considerations and empirical data relevant to attaining these goals. First, we mention four principles for system design which we believe are necessary to attain these goals; Then we present survey results that demonstrate that our principles are not really all that obvious, but just seem obvious once presented. The responses of designers suggest they may sometimes think they are doing what we recommend when in fact they are not. This is consistent with the experience that systems designers do not often recommend or use them themselves. We contrast some of these responses with what we have in mind in order to provide a more useful description of our principles. Lastly, we consider why this might be so. These sections are summaries of those in a longer paper to appear elsewhere (Gould {\&} Lewis, 1983). In that paper we elaborate on our four principles, showing how they form the basis for a general methodology of design, and we describe a successful example of using them in actual system design (IBM's Audio Distribution System).},

abstract = {Microarrays are relatively new, high-throughput data acquisition technology for investigating biological phenomena at the micro-level. One of the more common procedures for microarray experimentation is that of the microarray time-course experiment. The product of microarray time-course experiment is time-series data, which subject to proper analysis has the potential to have significant impact on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases. While existing information visualization techniques go some way to making microarray time-series data more manageable, requirements analysis has revealed significant limitations. The main finding was that users were unable to uncover and quantify common changes in value over a specified time-period. This paper describes a novel technique that provides this functionality by allowing the user to visually formulate and modify measurable queries with separate time-period and condition components. These visual queries are supported by the combination of a traditional value against time graph representation of the data with a complementary scatter-plot representation of a specified time-period. The multiple views of the visualization are coordinated so that the user can formulate and modify queries with rapid reversible display of query results in the traditional value against time graph format.},

journal={Scientific Reports},

volume={7},

pages={6731},
abstract={Cellular responses to stimuli are rapid and continuous and yet the vast majority of investigations of transcriptional responses during developmental transitions typically use long interval time courses; limiting the available interpretive power. Moreover, such experiments typically focus on protein-coding transcripts, ignoring the important impact of long noncoding RNAs. We therefore evaluated coding and noncoding expression dynamics at unprecedented temporal resolution (6-hourly) in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells and report new insight into molecular processes and genome organization. We present a highly resolved differentiation cascade that exhibits coding and noncoding transcriptional alterations, transcription factor network interactions and alternative splicing events, little of which can be resolved by long-interval developmental time-courses. We describe novel short lived and cycling patterns of gene expression and dissect temporally ordered gene expression changes in response to transcription factors. We elucidate patterns in gene co-expression across the genome, describe asynchronous transcription at bidirectional promoters and functionally annotate known and novel regulatory lncRNAs. These findings highlight the complex and dynamic molecular events underlying mammalian differentiation that can only be observed though a temporally resolved time course.},

abstract = {In this paper we reflect on the process of co-design by detailing and comparing two strategies for the participatory development of interaction concepts and prototypes in the context of technologically-enhanced museum visiting experiences. While much work in CSCW, HCI and related disciplines has examined different role configurations in co- design, more research is needed on examining how collaborative design processes can unfold in different ways. Here we present two instances of co-design of museum visiting aids, one stemming from an open brief, another from an initial working prototype; we discuss the process in each case and discuss how these alternative strategies presented the team with different possibilities as well as constraints, and led to different patterns of collaboration within the design team. Finally, we draw a set of themes for discussion and reflection to inform and aid researchers and practitioners participating in similar co-design processes, particularly},

@article{Setlur2016,
abstract = {Figure 1: Eviza's interface showing a map of earthquake data in the United States. The interface supports natural language analytical questions in the context of a visualization. Here, the map shows marks selected in response to the user's query " find large earthquakes near California. " The system semantically associates the sized descriptor 'large' to an attribute in the dataset called 'magnitude' that can be associated with size. Eviza finds two ambiguities in the query: 'large' and 'near,' which are fuzzy terms for size and distance. The system sets 'large' to be of magnitude 5 and greater, while 'near' is a 100 mile radius around the border of California. Two ambiguity widgets are added to the interface to allow the user to modify these settings. ABSTRACT Natural language interfaces for visualizations have emerged as a promising new way of interacting with data and performing ana-lytics. Many of these systems have fundamental limitations. Most return minimally interactive visualizations in response to queries and often require experts to perform modeling for a set of predicted user queries before the systems are effective. Eviza provides a natural language interface for an interactive query dialog with an existing visualization rather than starting from a blank sheet and ask-ing closed-ended questions that return a single text answer or static visualization. The system employs a probabilistic grammar based approach with predefined rules that are dynamically updated based on the data from the visualization, as opposed to computationally intensive deep learning or knowledge based approaches. The result of an interaction is a change to the view (e.g., filtering, navigation, selection) providing graphical answers and ambiguity widgets to handle ambiguous queries and system defaults. There is also rich domain awareness of time, space, and quantitative reason-ing built in, and linking into existing knowledge bases for additional semantics. Eviza also supports pragmatics and exploring multi-modal interactions to help enhance the expressiveness of how users can ask questions about their data during the flow of visual analysis.},

@article{Kandel2012,
abstract = {Organizations rely on data analysts to model customer engagement, streamline operations, improve production, inform business decisions, and combat fraud. Though numerous analysis and visualization tools have been built to improve the scale and efficiency at which analysts can work, there has been little research on how analysis takes place within the social and organizational context of companies. To better understand the enterprise analysts' ecosystem, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 35 data analysts from 25 organizations across a variety of sectors, including healthcare, retail, marketing and finance. Based on our interview data, we characterize the process of industrial data analysis and document how organizational features of an enterprise impact it. We describe recurring pain points, outstanding challenges, and barriers to adoption for visual analytic tools. Finally, we discuss design implications and opportunities for visual analysis research.},
